        <h3>The Background:</h3>

        <p>Thanks to Moore and colleagues, mobile devices have not just become technically feasible, but pervasive today. Consequently, the peripherals to this silicon were forced to get better to keep up. Small high resolution displays and image sensors have become exponentially cheaper since the turn of the century.</p>

        <p>Like with the first language models, mobile phones improved so fast generation over generation it blindsided the need for more root innovation and exploration of what a computer can be. That was until Luckey with Oculus, he found the perfect vertex where Moore allowed realtime optics distortion correction, and Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) that were cheap enough for the consumer.</p>

        <p>A few generations later around 2019 two things happened.</p>

        <p>First Qualcomm launched its second generation Extended Reality (xr) chip with 8 ARMv8 cores, an Adreno 615 GPU, NPU for hand detection, and performance and battery life 2x from the generation before.</p>

        <p>Second, inside out tracking got very good and robust. This turned vr from an experience in a room into a mobile one anyone could buy and use.</p>

        <p>All things considered it was clear that Quest 2 was bound to succeed the way it did. You could say these two technical changes led to XR finally going mainstream, because the device just worked.</p>

        <h3>The Project:</h3>

        <p>The EM spectrum is so large that irl gradient descent (evolution) decided we don't need to see in the infrared spectrum (IR). So by gluing some Chinese IR LEDs to the front of a Quest 2 and a constant current LED driver yields high-quality real-time night vision for under $350, very cool. But if you were dumb you would say "what if isis found out about this". Luckily with the external LEDs on, you become a very bright shoot me beacon to the good guys with IR cameras. Also a phased array EMP could turn this device to a Watch Dogs 2 quick kill very fast.</p>

        <p>Today even cheaper cameras at higher specs means that perception for machines is practically solved. That being from mobile device's photos/pictures to tracking systems for self driving that used to use Laser Detection and Rangeing (LiDAR) that cost as much as a used prius. Overall, this was a fun weekend project to walk around in the dark with. But it shows that solving robotics from self driving to humanoids is now a software and brushless DC motor factory problem.</p>

        <p>So the next question is who will be the Palmer Luckey of robotics?</p>
